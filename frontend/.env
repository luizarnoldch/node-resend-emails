# Frontend Application

## Overview

This project is a frontend application built with React and Vite. It interacts with a backend service to fetch and send data. To properly configure the frontend to communicate with the backend, you need to set up the `VITE_BACKEND_API` environment variable.

## Environment Variables

To configure the frontend application, you need to set the following environment variable:

- `VITE_BACKEND_API`: The base URL of your backend API.

### Setting Up Environment Variables

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your frontend project directory (if it doesn't already exist).

2. **Add the following variable** to the `.env` file:

    ```plaintext
    VITE_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:3000
    ```

    Adjust the URL as needed if your backend is hosted at a different address.

3. **Restart your Vite development server** to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

## Node.js Version

This project requires Node.js version 20.16.0. Make sure you have this version installed for compatibility:
